<h1 style="color:blue">About Me</h1>
<p>I crank out code like a boss - full-stack development is my day job, and I love the challenge of transforming ideas into digital realities. But there's another side to me that thrives on creativity. </p>
<p>When I'm not wrangling code, my fingers come alive on the organ keys. Music is my escape, a way to express emotions that coding can't quite capture. It's a beautiful contrast, logic by day and melody by night. And maybe that's why I'm drawn to investing as well - it's a blend of seeing the potential in something and nurturing it to reach its full potential.

  <p>Yeah, I guess you could say I wear a few hats, but hey, that keeps things interesting!</p>
